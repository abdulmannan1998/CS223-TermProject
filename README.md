A cellular Automaton game that is somewhat similar to the popular 70s "The Game of Life". In a cellular automaton, the next state of a middle cell is dependent on the current state of its neighbours. We apply some sort of rule to determine in what condition should a cell be on in the next state.
A more detailed report is available in the given files.
